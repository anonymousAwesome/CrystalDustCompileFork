This is a fork of Pokemon Crystal Dust. Specifically, the d3a628c1a4297e70b6300b695ddfe521388d1d77 branch. Since that branch wouldn't compile on my computer, I had to go in and make some changes to the code, based mostly on the bugfixes found in the Pokemon Emerald decomp, as well as a few AI-assisted best guesses where I couldn't find the fix in the decomp.

# Pokémon CrystalDust

This is a ROM hack of Pokémon Emerald that aims to recreate Pokémon Crystal on the GBA, as if Game Freak had remade it themselves at that time.

To set up the repository, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md).

This project is based on [**pokeemerald**](https://github.com/pret/pokeemerald), a decompilation of Pokémon Emerald.
